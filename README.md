### Long-term Goals
- Integrate **Strapi CMS** for dynamic content management.

## TODO List

- [ ] Improve SEO by adding metadata for better search visibility.

## Future Integrations

### Strapi CMS on Railway (Planned)

In the future, we plan to integrate **Strapi** as the headless CMS to manage content more efficiently. Strapi will be deployed on **Railway**, allowing us to quickly set up and scale our backend infrastructure.

To integrate:

2. Connect the Next.js frontend to Strapi via REST or GraphQL API.
3. Create custom content types for managing clients, portfolios, and case studies.
